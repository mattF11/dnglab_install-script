# dnglab_install-script
A script to install and peform basic operations with dnglab.
As i'm learning bash scripting for a simple and amateur use,these scripts can be usefull,in this case,installing and perform basic operations with dnglab.
The idea of the bash script came as i felt the need to semplify my workflow: easily  convert my ARW files without the need to lookout for notes and documentation, run and select with the settings i need,the programs i use for editing all support dng files.
